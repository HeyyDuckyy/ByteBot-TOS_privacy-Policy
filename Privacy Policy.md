Last Updated: 09/17/2025

This Privacy Policy explains how BYTE Bot (“we”, “our”, “the Service”) collects, uses, and protects information. By inviting or using BYTE Bot, you agree to the practices described below.

# 1. Information We Collect

BYTE Bot may collect and store the following data:

Discord User IDs – to identify users.

Guild (Server) IDs – to manage server-specific settings.

Channel & Role IDs – for features such as ticket systems, auto-roles, and reaction roles.

Configuration Data – any settings you configure through commands or dashboards.

We do not collect personally identifiable information such as real names, email addresses, payment information, or passwords.

# 2. How We Use Information

Collected data is used strictly to:

Provide and operate BYTE Bot’s features.

Maintain service stability and improve performance.

Prevent abuse, spam, and misuse of the Service.

Data is never used for marketing, profiling, or advertising purposes.

# 3. Data Storage & Security

All data is stored in a secured database.

Reasonable industry-standard measures are taken to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Despite safeguards, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure; use of the Service is at your own risk.

# 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell or trade your information. Data may only be shared:

With Discord (to comply with their API requirements).

With service providers necessary to run the bot (e.g., hosting providers, cloud storage).

If required by law, court order, or government request.

# 5. Data Retention

Data is retained only as long as necessary to provide services.

When BYTE Bot is removed from a server, associated configuration data is scheduled for deletion after a reasonable period.

Backups may persist temporarily but are regularly purged.

# 6. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), you may have the right to:

Request a copy of your data.

Request deletion of your data.

Withdraw consent at any time by removing BYTE Bot from your server.

Requests may be submitted through our official support channel (see Contact).

# 7. Children’s Privacy

BYTE Bot is not intended for users under 13 years old, or the minimum digital consent age in your country.

We do not knowingly collect data from children. If discovered, such data will be promptly deleted.

# 8. Third-Party Services

BYTE Bot relies on third-party APIs and services (such as Discord, Twitch, YouTube, and potentially OpenAI for AI features).
Use of these services is subject to their respective privacy policies. We do not control how these third parties handle your data.

# 9. Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Notice of material changes will be posted in the support server.
Continued use of BYTE Bot after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

# 10. Limitation of Liability

BYTE Bot is provided “as is” without warranty. We are not liable for any damages arising from use, misuse, or inability to use the Service, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
